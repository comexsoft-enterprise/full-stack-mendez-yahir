# Full-Stack-candidate-challenge
Challenge to assess the candidate’s programming knowledge.

The following exercise consists of working with a list of Pokémon. You may change the file extension from .jsx to .tsx if it is more convenient for you.
You will need to add functionalities to this list.
Design and styling will also be taken into account.

1.- Display the first 20 Pokémon. Each item in the list should include the Pokémon’s appearance and name.
2.- Implement Pokémon selection. A Pokédex is shown on the right side of the list. Selection flow: select a Pokémon → click the arrow at the top of the list → move the selected Pokémon to the Pokédex.
3.- Allow Pokémon to be returned from the Pokédex back to the list.

Extra (advanced options):
4.- When the user scrolls to the bottom of the list, load 20 additional Pokémon and append them.
5.- Implement the same functionality from step 2 using drag-and-drop. Also include a button to activate this mode.
